# JavaScript Fundamentals Course
<h1>Exercises and Challenges</h1>

In this repository I will throw up the challenges proposed by **@jonasschmedtman** in the UDEMY course: The Complete **JavaScript** Course 2021: From Zero to Expert; in addition to some other exercises proposed by the Tutor **@Joao_Bernardino.

The Complete JavaScript Course contains over 25 coding challenges to practice the concepts to learn in each section. This is part of the full structured and complete design and web development course, offered for the **IEFP - Instituto do Emprego e FormaÃ§Ã£o Profissional de Portugal,** and it is a fundamental part of my learning journey ðŸ¤“
